# 📱 Instagram Cleaned – Android App (Kotlin)

**Status:** ⏸️ Project on hold

This Android application allows users to browse Instagram **without ads, Reels, or suggested posts**. Built with Kotlin in Android Studio, it uses a `WebView` combined with injected **JavaScript scripts** to detect and remove unwanted interface elements.

The app offers a **cleaner and lighter Instagram experience**, without relying on third-party APIs or altering the platform's core functionality.
